  faqs: [
  {
    "q": "What is Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security?",
    "a": "Ethical hacking is the authorised practice of testing computer systems, networks, and applications for security vulnerabilities — using the same tools and techniques as malicious hackers, but with explicit permission and the goal of fixing weaknesses before criminals can exploit them. Cyber security is the broader discipline of protecting digital assets, data, networks, and infrastructure from unauthorised access, attacks, and damage. Ethical hacking is one specialised practice within the much larger field of cyber security, which also includes network defence, security operations (SOC), digital forensics, governance and compliance, and incident response. DizitalAdda Foundation in Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking introduces both the defensive side (networking, Linux hardening, firewalls) and the offensive side (vulnerability scanning, password attacks, reporting) so beginners understand the full picture before specialising further. Call +91-8810606010."
  },
  {
    "q": "What tools will I learn in DizitalAdda foundation cyber security course?",
    "a": "DizitalAdda Foundation in Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking covers hands-on practice with Kali Linux (the standard penetration testing operating system), Burp Suite (web application testing), Nmap (network scanning), Wireshark (packet and traffic analysis), Metasploit (exploitation framework), OWASP ZAP (web vulnerability scanning), Nessus (vulnerability assessment), John the Ripper and Hydra (password cracking and brute-force attacks), SQLmap (SQL injection testing), Shodan (internet-connected device search), Aircrack-ng (wireless security testing), Python (security scripting and automation), and VirtualBox (lab virtualisation). Every tool is practised in a safe, isolated lab environment on realistic attack and defence scenarios. Call +91-8810606010."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need prior coding or networking knowledge to join the foundation course?",
    "a": "No. DizitalAdda Foundation in Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking is specifically designed for absolute beginners — basic computer literacy is the only prerequisite. Networking fundamentals (OSI model, IP addressing, subnetting, TCP/IP) and Linux fundamentals (file systems, permissions, Bash scripting) are taught from the ground up in dedicated modules before any ethical hacking content is introduced. Python is also taught from basics, focused specifically on security automation use cases rather than general-purpose programming, so students with zero coding background can follow along comfortably. Call +91-8810606010 for a counselling session."
  },
  {

  faqs: [
  {
    "q": "What is VAPT (Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing)?",
    "a": "VAPT is a combined security testing process: Vulnerability Assessment identifies and catalogues known weaknesses in systems, networks, and applications using automated scanning tools, while Penetration Testing goes a step further by actively attempting to exploit those weaknesses to determine real-world impact and confirm whether they are genuinely exploitable. Together, VAPT gives organisations both a comprehensive list of vulnerabilities and a realistic assessment of which ones pose actual risk. DizitalAdda Advanced Certification dedicates a full module to VAPT, teaching vulnerability scanning with Nessus and OpenVAS, manual and automated penetration testing methodology, exploitation using Metasploit, web application testing against the OWASP Top 10, and professional report writing and remediation recommendations — the exact workflow used by VAPT consultants in industry. Call +91-8810606010."
  },
  {
    "q": "What tools will I learn in DizitalAdda advanced cyber security certification?",

  },
  {
    "q": "Will I learn network penetration testing in the advanced certification?",
    "a": "Yes, in depth. The Advanced Certification covers TCP/IP, OSI model and protocols, subnetting, routing, NAT and DNS, packet analysis with Wireshark, port scanning and traffic sniffing, and network security controls in the dedicated Networking module — followed by full exploitation practice using Metasploit and Nmap in the VAPT module. This combination of networking theory and hands-on exploitation is what distinguishes the advanced programme from the foundation-level introduction to networking concepts. Call +91-8810606010."
  },
  {
    "q": "Will I learn web application penetration testing in the advanced certification?",
    "a": "Yes. The VAPT module includes dedicated web application testing against the OWASP Top 10 — covering SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), authentication bypass, and other common web vulnerabilities — practised hands-on using Burp Suite and SQLmap on realistic lab applications. This builds directly on the ethical hacking fundamentals covered earlier in the programme, applying them specifically to modern web application architectures that most Indian companies rely on for customer-facing systems. Call +91-8810606010."
  },
  {
    "q": "What certifications will I earn from the advanced cyber security certification?",
    "a": "Students completing DizitalAdda Advanced Certification in Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking receive the DizitalAdda Advanced Certification in Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking, Skill India recognition, and structured exam preparation guidance for CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker), CompTIA Security+, and OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) — the certifications most frequently requested in mid-level VAPT and penetration testing job listings in India. Combined with a portfolio of VAPT reports and forensic case studies, this certification bundle gives mid-level candidates a strong, verifiable hiring credential. Call +91-8810606010."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the difference between Foundation, Advanced, and Expert cyber security courses at DizitalAdda?",
    "a": "DizitalAdda Foundation in Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking (4 months / 96 hours) covers security fundamentals and basic ethical hacking for absolute beginners. The Advanced Certification (6 months / 144 hours) builds on that with professional Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) and Digital and Cyber Forensic Investigation — designed for students with some prior exposure or working professionals seeking career advancement. The Expert Training (12 months / 288 hours) covers everything in Foundation and Advanced plus Web Application Penetration Testing, Mobile App Penetration Testing, AWS Cloud Security, IoT Security, Malware Analysis, and Endpoint Security for senior, specialist-level roles.

  faqs: [
  {
    "q": "What is Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security, and how does the expert programme cover it?",
    "a": "Ethical hacking is the authorised practice of testing systems and networks for vulnerabilities before malicious hackers can exploit them, while cyber security is the broader field protecting digital assets, data, and infrastructure from cyber threats. DizitalAdda Expert Training in Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking covers both disciplines across the widest range of domains of any DizitalAdda programme — fundamentals, networking, and Linux, through ethical hacking and VAPT, into specialist areas including web and mobile application security, cloud security, IoT security, malware analysis, and endpoint defence — giving graduates the complete skill stack used by senior security professionals across offensive, defensive, and investigative roles. Call +91-8810606010."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is included in the AWS Cloud Security module of the expert training?",
    "a": "DizitalAdda Expert Training in Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking includes a dedicated AWS Cloud Security module covering AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) configuration and misconfiguration risks, security groups and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) setup, common S3 bucket vulnerabilities (a leading cause of real-world cloud data breaches), cloud penetration testing guidelines specific to AWS shared responsibility model, and monitoring and logging using AWS CloudTrail. As more Indian companies migrate infrastructure to AWS, cloud security skills have become one of the highest-demand specialisations in cybersecurity hiring, and this module is designed to make graduates job-ready for cloud security analyst roles. Call +91-8810606010."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is malware analysis and why is it covered in the expert training?",
    "a": "Malware analysis is the practice of examining malicious software — viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware — to understand how it behaves, spreads, and can be detected or removed. DizitalAdda Expert Training covers both static analysis (examining malware code without executing it) and dynamic analysis (observing malware behaviour in a controlled, isolated sandbox environment), along with signature detection techniques, common malware obfuscation methods used by attackers, and building basic malware detection tools. This is a senior-level specialisation that significantly increases earning potential, since experienced malware analysts are in short supply relative to demand at Indian SOC teams and incident response firms. Call +91-8810606010."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is mobile application penetration testing and is it covered?",
    "a": "Yes.
